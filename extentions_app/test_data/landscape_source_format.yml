              summary_use_case: >
                Kratix is a framework for building composable internal developer platforms (IDPs). 
                Kratix enables platform teams to offer everything(X)-as-a-service to enable developers to ship code faster, safer, and at scale.
                
                The three core components of Kratix are Promises, Workflows, and Fleet Management.                 
                A Kratix Promise is an API contract between the Platform and its users. Kratix Workflows define reusable actions (and "aspects") that hook into the Promise lifecycle. 
                Kratix implements fleet management using GitOps principles to continually reconcile desired cluster and platform states.

                Kratix acts as a platform orchestrator, integrating and acting as the glue between app management UX (portals, APIs, CLI) and infrastructure as code (IaC).
                In addition to providing the ability to create platform/service APIs via Promises, Kratix also manages the lifecycle of the platform itself, supporting day 1, day 2, and day 2000 operations.

              summary_business_use_case: >
                KubeEdge has found widespread adoption across multiple industries, including transportation, energy, internet, CDN, manufacturing, and smart
                campuses. Some of the notable use cases include:

                Tiansuan Constellation Program: KubeEdge has been integrated into the cloud-native satellite computing platform initiated by the Shenzhen
                Institute of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with Spacety Co., Ltd. KubeEdge brings in orbit-earth collaboration for
                the Tiansuan-1 Satellite in the platform, this integration has enabled new service scenarios such as image inference, incremental deep learning,
                and federated learning.

                China's highway electronic toll collection (ETC) system: KubeEdge has been instrumental in managing nearly 100,000 edge nodes and over 500,000
                edge applications in 29 of China's 34 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. With these applications, the system processes more than
                300 million data records daily and supports continuous updates of ETC services on highways. As a result, the time taken to pass through toll
                stations has been reduced from 29s to 3s for trucks, and from 15s to 2s for cars.

                Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge: KubeEdge manages edge nodes deployed on the world's longest sea crossing bridge, which collects up to 14
                different types of sensor data, including light intensity, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, noise, temperature, humidity, PM 2.5, PM 10,
                rain and snow, acceleration, angular velocity, Euler angle, magnetic field, and sound. It also enables business apps and device mapper and AI
                interference programs to be deployed at the edge.

                SAIC MAXUS MIFA 9: The next-generation car-cloud collaborative architecture, SAIC MAXUS full-size luxury, smart, pure electric MPV MIFA 9, has
                become the first-ever vehicle with KubeEdge Inside. This platform can manage 100,000+ nodes and millions of edge devices and is based on
                KubeEdge's capabilities such as lightweight architecture, optimized for unstable cloud-edge networks at scale, simplified heterogeneous IoT
                device management, and edge autonomy in the case of disconnection.

                CDN platform of China Telecom: KubeEdge is used to manage CDN edge nodes, automatically deploy and upgrade CDN edge services, and implement edge
                service disaster recovery (DR) when migrating CDN services to the cloud.

                China Mobile On-line Marketing Service Center: The largest call center in the world, with 44,000 agents, 900 million users, and 53 customer
                service centers, builds a cloud-edge synergy architecture consisting of two centers and multiple edges based on KubeEdge.

                Xinghai IoT: This IoT company provides comprehensive smart building solutions by leveraging a construction IoT platform, intelligent hardware,
                and AI. Xinghai IoT built a smart campus with cloud-edge-device synergy based on KubeEdge and its own Xinghai IoT cloud platform, greatly
                improving the efficiency of campus management. With AI assistance, nearly 30% of the repetitive work is automated.

                SF Express: The largest integrated logistics service provider in China and the fourth largest in the world, completely transformed their supply
                chains by implementing KubeEdge. The smart supply chain system enables edge-cloud synergy, edge data collection, real-time edge data processing,
                massive IoT device management, and creates a more stable, secure, and reliable edge industrial IoT system.

              summary_use_case: "cert-manager\_is a powerful and extensible X.509 certificate controller for Kubernetes and OpenShift workloads. It will obtain certificates from a variety of Issuers, both popular public Issuers as well as private Issuers, and ensure the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry."
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Manual certificate management is an outage waiting to happen; it only takes one forgotten renewal to bring down an entire site. Automation is
                therefore key to reliability, and cert-manager is the foremost tool for achieving this in Kubernetes. In addition, workloads such as service
                meshes can require local certificate authorities, and cert-manager can help in issuing and controlling these key parts of infrastructure.

                Falco is a cloud-native runtime security project that makes it easy to consume kernel events. Falco enriches these events with additional
                information from the Kubernetes platform and ecosystem as well as the rest of the cloud native stack. Falco can also be extended to other data
                sources through the use of plugins. Falco offers a rich set of security rules designed for Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud native environments.
                When a rule is violated in the system, Falco alerts users with details about the violation and severity.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                You can think about Falco as a security camera for containers, Kubernetes and the cloud: it collects signals from hosts, containers,
                orchestrators and cloud logs, and it reports suspicious or anomalous behavior. Falco provides kernel instrumentation mechanisms to detect
                security events. It then enriches them with metadata pulled from the node, the container runtime and Kubernetes. This metadata is then used to
                dynamically apply Falco rules based on the container name, image, orchestrator labels, orchestrator resource type, etc.

                be focused on the in-toto Attestation specification. Changes to the in-toto specifications are introduced and evaluated as in-toto Enhancements
                (ITE), ensuring stability in the specifications themselves. This is a key factor as both the in-toto specification and the Attestation framework
                are widely used.

                Keycloak is an Open-Source Identity and Access Management Solution for Modern Applications and Services. The project is primarily designed to
                make it easy  for developers to secure their applications with minimal effort.

                Keycloak builds on top of industry security standard protocols supporting OAuth2, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn. It also empowers administrators and
                users,  providing an extensive and friendly interface to configure and manage Keycloak. Existing security infrastructure like SAML2 based IdPs,
                LDAP servers,  Kerberos/SPNEGO, custom user storage solutions are easy to integrate while making their presence transparent to applications and
                end users.

                Keycloak provides fully customizable login pages, strong authentication, support for password recovery, client secret rotation, recovery codes
                for 2FA,  terms and conditions, step-up authentication, and a lot more. All of this without any need for coding at all. All pages visible to
                users support custom themes, making  it easy to modify the look and feel of the pages to integrate with your corporate branding and existing
                applications.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Keycloak provides built-in cloud-native identity and access control standards. By delegating the security aspects of an application to
                Keycloak,  developers don't need to worry about different authentication mechanisms, understand about cryptography, or how to safely store
                passwords.

                Developers can take advantage of modern authentication and authorization protocols like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn, SAML2 based IDPs, LDAP
                servers, Kerberos/SPNEGO.

                Keycloak enables infrastructure teams and cloud-native developers to secure their cloud-native stack technologies through consolidated security
                standards, to provide to users a cloud-friendly experience with a strong focus on usability, scalability, and security.

              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Embracing WebAssembly for policies means that Policy Authors can use their preferred tooling (language libraries, Git, CI);
                thus lowering knowledge barrier and silos, reducing training, and minimizing ad-hoc solutions.
                Thanks to policies being WebAssembly, Kubewarden policies can leverage and reuse upstream libraries to expand on current policy solutions while
                keeping compatibility (e.g: its cel-policy uses Kubernetes' cel-go interpreter, its kyverno-policy compiles a subset of Kyverno codebase to
                support Kyverno's YAML-like DSL). 
                Kubewarden policy CRDs and PolicyServer CRD enable insulation of consumers per namespace, and self-service.

              testing, image  control, container deployment, container operation, etc. Shangfu also integrates security with development which means providing
              feedback of the  application security condition through correlating operation asset, and promoting the iteration and upgrade of application.
              Whereupon, a closed  loop of efficient cloud native application security risk is created, covering the whole stages of DevSecOps.

                OpenFGA enables developers to implement highly performant and flexible authorization for their applications. It incorporates Relationship-Based
                Access Control (ReBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) concepts with a domain-specific language that simplifies crafting authorization
                and permission solutions, scalable to any use case and scale
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Application authorization is often implemented differently across a company's applications and hard-coded in application code, making it
                challenging to evolve and comprehend. This difficulty leads to poorly implemented authorization, a top security risk identified by OWASP.
                OpenFGA provides a flexible, centralized, and scalable authorization system to address this issue.

                There are good open source and commercial-based solutions for providing threat detection for virtual machines, but challenges come with
                assembling these yourself. Cloud and container environments are complex with installation, configuration, and reporting. Integrating with
                existing deployment automation is always a consideration with any addition to a cloud native environment Siloed reporting and visualization and
                a lack of a single view into your configuration
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Virtual machines (VM’s) are the number one most used service on AWS, Azure and GCP and the predominate method for hosting containers. Despite
                this extensive use, VM’s are vulnerable to muyltiple threats incluyding leaked secrets and passwords, malware, system misconfiguration, and
                rootkit software used by cybercriminals to gain control over a target computer or network.

                The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) Project defines a framework and set of standards for identifying and securing
                communications between application services. At its core, SPIFFE is:


                A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource
                Identifiers (URIs).


                A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.


                An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload API.


                The SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment), that in addition to the above, it:


                - Performs node and workload attestation.


                - Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.


                - Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.


                - Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication and encryption between workloads.


                - Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services meshes and cloud provider services.


                - Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous environments and administrative trust boundaries


                The SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to
                establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can
                also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                In today's business environment, rapidly delivering innovative customer experiences through differentiated applications and services is
                necessary for competitive advantage. As a result, organizations witness a change in how applications and services are being architected, built,
                and deployed. New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster, at scale. Services need to be built at high
                velocity and deployed on a vast plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming increasingly interdependent and
                interconnected to deliver a consistent customer experience.


                Organizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance,
                the pool of expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within existing solutions.


                For business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of
                managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate development and deployment by removing the need
                for developers to understand the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service communication.


                Technology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge when different technology stacks must come together and
                interoperate. Aligning on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with identity and authentication, simplifies
                the technical aspects of full interoperability and integration across multiple stacks.


                SPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity. By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate
                systems in different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN
                tunnels, one-o certificates, or shared credentials for use between such systems.
